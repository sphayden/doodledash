# üé® DoodleDash

A multiplayer drawing game where players create artwork based on prompts and an AI judge evaluates the results. Built with React, Node.js, Socket.io, and OpenAI.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time multiplayer gameplay** with WebSocket connections
- **AI-powered judging** using OpenAI's vision models
- **Interactive drawing canvas** with multiple tools and colors
- **Lobby system** with room codes for private games
- **Voting mechanics** with tie-breaker resolution
- **Responsive design** that works on desktop and mobile
- **Developer tools** for testing and debugging

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.x or higher
- npm 8.x or higher

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/doodledash.git
   cd doodledash
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Copy example environment file
   cp server/.env.example server/.env
   
   # Add your OpenAI API key to server/.env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Start development servers**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This starts:
   - React client on http://localhost:3000
   - Node.js server on http://localhost:3001

### Production Deployment

The application is configured for easy deployment on Railway:

1. **Build the application**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start production server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The server serves both the API and the built React frontend.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Frontend (`/client`)
- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **Bootstrap 5** for styling
- **Fabric.js** for canvas drawing
- **Socket.io-client** for real-time communication

### Backend (`/server`)
- **Express.js** server
- **Socket.io** for WebSocket connections
- **OpenAI API** for AI judging
- **Joi** for request validation

### Key Components
- **GameManager**: Unified interface for game state management
- **SocketGameManager**: Socket.io implementation with error handling
- **DevTools**: Developer utilities for testing game flows
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and user feedback

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Start a Game**: Create a room or join with a room code
2. **Wait for Players**: Games need 2-6 players to start
3. **Vote on Prompts**: Choose what everyone will draw
4. **Draw**: Create your masterpiece in the time limit
5. **AI Judging**: OpenAI evaluates all drawings
6. **Results**: See scores and play again!
