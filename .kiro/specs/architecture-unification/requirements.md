# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Doodle multiplayer drawing game in the `doodle-revamp` folder currently has mixed architecture with both P2P (PeerJS) and Socket.io implementations. While the app currently uses `SocketGameManager`, there are still remnants of `P2PGameManager` code and inconsistencies in the implementation. The goal is to unify the codebase around a single, robust networking architecture that provides a solid foundation for future feature development.

Note: The `Doodle` folder contains legacy C# ASP.NET code that is for reference only (art assets, etc.) and should not be modified.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN there SHALL be only one networking implementation active
2. WHEN a new developer joins the project THEN they SHALL find clear, unambiguous networking code

4. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN players SHALL receive clear error messages
5. WHEN reconnecting after a brief disconnect THEN players SHALL be able to rejoin their game

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean separation of concerns, so that networking, game logic, and UI are independently maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the code THEN networking logic SHALL be contained in service classes
2. WHEN examining the code THEN game state management SHALL be separate from networking
3. WHEN examining the code THEN UI components SHALL only interact with game state, not networking directly
4. WHEN testing components THEN they SHALL be testable without real network connections
5. WHEN modifying networking THEN UI components SHALL not require changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling, so that network failures don't crash the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connection fails THEN the application SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN server is unreachable THEN the application SHALL provide fallback options or retry mechanisms
3. WHEN invalid data is received THEN the application SHALL handle it gracefully without crashing
4. WHEN connection is lost mid-game THEN players SHALL be notified and given options to reconnect
5. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient detail for debugging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent TypeScript interfaces, so that the type system helps prevent bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working with game state THEN all interfaces SHALL be strongly typed
2. WHEN working with network messages THEN all message types SHALL be defined with TypeScript
3. WHEN compiling the project THEN there SHALL be no TypeScript errors or warnings
4. WHEN adding new features THEN existing type definitions SHALL guide implementation
5. WHEN refactoring THEN the type system SHALL catch breaking changes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want all existing game features to work identically, so that the architectural changes don't affect my gameplay experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hosting a game THEN the lobby system SHALL work exactly as before
2. WHEN voting for words THEN the voting system SHALL work exactly as before
3. WHEN drawing THEN the canvas and drawing tools SHALL work exactly as before
4. WHEN there's a voting tie THEN the tie-breaker modal SHALL work exactly as before
5. WHEN the game ends THEN results SHALL be displayed exactly as before

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and examples, so that I can understand and extend the networking system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading the code THEN networking classes SHALL have comprehensive JSDoc comments
2. WHEN implementing new features THEN there SHALL be clear examples of how to use the networking API
3. WHEN debugging THEN there SHALL be consistent logging patterns throughout the networking code
4. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN there SHALL be architectural documentation explaining the design decisions
5. WHEN extending functionality THEN there SHALL be clear patterns to follow

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ability to easily switch between development and production networking configurations, so that I can test locally and deploy to different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing locally THEN the system SHALL connect to a local development server
2. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL connect to the production server
3. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL use mock networking or test servers
4. WHEN configuring environments THEN connection settings SHALL be easily changeable via environment variables
5. WHEN debugging THEN different log levels SHALL be available for development vs production

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive developer tools and automated testing capabilities, so that I can easily verify game functionality and catch regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing THEN there SHALL be a developer panel to simulate different game states
2. WHEN testing multiplayer scenarios THEN there SHALL be tools to simulate multiple players without manual setup
3. WHEN testing game flow THEN there SHALL be automated ways to trigger voting, drawing, and results phases
4. WHEN debugging network issues THEN there SHALL be tools to inspect message flow and game state changes
5. WHEN running automated tests THEN there SHALL be test utilities that can verify game logic without UI interaction
6. WHEN testing edge cases THEN there SHALL be tools to simulate network failures, disconnections, and error conditions
7. WHEN validating functionality THEN there SHALL be automated checks that verify game state consistency across all players

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to handle high traffic loads with multiple concurrent lobbies, so that the game remains responsive and stable under heavy usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there are 100+ concurrent lobbies THEN the system SHALL maintain response times under 2 seconds
2. WHEN server memory usage exceeds 80% THEN the system SHALL implement graceful degradation or scaling
3. WHEN multiple players join simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent connections without race conditions
4. WHEN traffic spikes occur THEN the system SHALL auto-scale or queue requests appropriately
5. WHEN a server instance fails THEN active games SHALL be preserved or gracefully transferred
6. WHEN monitoring the system THEN there SHALL be metrics for active rooms, player count, memory usage, and response times
7. WHEN the system reaches capacity limits THEN new room creation SHALL be throttled with appropriate user feedback

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a production-ready deployment strategy with proper environment configuration, so that the application can be reliably deployed and maintained in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL serve both frontend and backend from a single domain
2. WHEN configuring environments THEN all sensitive data SHALL be stored in environment variables
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL validate all required configuration and fail fast if misconfigured
4. WHEN deploying updates THEN there SHALL be zero-downtime deployment capabilities
5. WHEN errors occur in production THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate detail for debugging

7. WHEN monitoring production THEN there SHALL be health checks and performance metrics available

### Requirement 12

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system architecture to support distributed scaling with shared state management, so that multiple server instances can work together seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running multiple server instances THEN game state SHALL be shared across all instances
2. WHEN a player connects THEN they SHALL be able to join games hosted on any server instance
3. WHEN implementing WebSocket clustering THEN sticky sessions SHALL be properly configured

5. WHEN a server instance restarts THEN active games SHALL continue on other instances
6. WHEN implementing caching THEN frequently accessed data SHALL be cached for performance
7. WHEN cleaning up resources THEN expired games and disconnected players SHALL be automatically removed
