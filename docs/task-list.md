## ðŸŽ¯ READY FOR TESTING

### **Complete Game Flow** âœ…
All core features are implemented and functional:

1. **Lobby System**: Host/join with room codes
2. **Word Voting**: Players vote on words with tie-breaking
3. **Drawing Phase**: All players draw simultaneously (60 seconds)
4. **AI Judging**: Server-side OpenAI GPT-4V evaluation
5. **Results Screen**: Rankings, scores, and drawing gallery

### **Technical Requirements Met** âœ…
- âœ… **Server**: Runs on port 3002 with all modules loaded
- âœ… **Client**: Builds successfully with TypeScript
- âœ… **Database**: Word management system functional
- âœ… **API Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4V ready (needs API key)

### **Testing Checklist** 
To test the complete system:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Add OpenAI API key to `server/.env`
   - Start server: `cd server && npm run dev`
   - Start client: `cd doodle-revamp/client && npm start`

2. **Multi-player Test Flow**:
   - [ ] Open http://localhost:3000 in two browser windows
   - [ ] Host game in first window, join with code in second
   - [ ] Complete voting phase
   - [ ] Draw during drawing phase
   - [ ] Submit drawings and view AI results
