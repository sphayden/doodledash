   - Best of both worlds but more complex

### Security Approach
- **Input Validation**: Strict validation on all P2P messages
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent message flooding attacks
- **Canvas Validation**: Ensure submitted drawings are legitimate
- **Host Authority**: Host maintains game state authority

### Performance Strategy
- **Lazy Loading**: Load components and assets as needed
