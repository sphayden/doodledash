# 🎨 Doodle Game - Server Architecture Migration

## ✅ Migration Status: READY FOR TESTING

The game has been successfully migrated from P2P to dedicated server architecture while maintaining the original game concept:

- **ALL players draw the same word simultaneously** ✅
- **AI judges the best drawing** ✅  
- **Server-based for reliability** ✅
- **Same UI and game flow** ✅

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- OpenAI API key
- npm or yarn

### 1. Setup Server
```bash
cd server
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your OPENAI_API_KEY
npm run dev
```

### 2. Setup Client  
```bash
cd doodle-revamp/client
npm install
npm start
```

### 3. Play the Game!
1. Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Enter your name
3. Host a game or join with room code
4. Vote on words
5. Draw the chosen word (60 seconds)
6. See AI judging results!

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### **Server (Node.js + Socket.io)**
```
server/
├── index.js              # Main server + Socket.io setup
├── gameManager.js         # Room management
├── gameRoom.js           # Individual game logic  
├── aiJudge.js            # OpenAI GPT-4V integration
├── wordManager.js        # Word lists and selection
└── utils/
    ├── roomCodeGenerator.js
    └── validation.js
```

### **Client (React + TypeScript)**
```
client/src/
├── services/
│   └── SocketGameManager.ts    # Replaces P2PGameManager
├── components/              # Existing UI components
└── App.tsx                 # Updated to use Socket.io
```

## 🎮 Game Flow

1. **Lobby** → Players join via room code
2. **Voting** → Players vote on 4 random words  
3. **Drawing** → ALL players draw chosen word (60s timer)
4. **AI Judging** → OpenAI GPT-4V evaluates all drawings
5. **Results** → Rankings, scores, and AI feedback displayed

---

## 🤖 AI Judging System

### **Features**
- **OpenAI GPT-4V** for accurate image recognition
- **Scoring 1-100** based on accuracy and creativity
- **Detailed feedback** for each drawing
- **Fallback system** if AI fails (random scores)
- **Cost optimization** using low-detail image processing

### **Scoring Criteria**
1. **Recognizability** - How clearly does it represent the word?
2. **Artistic effort** - Detail and creativity shown
3. **Accuracy** - How well does it match the actual appearance?

## 🔧 Configuration

### **Server Environment Variables**
```env
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...          # Your OpenAI API key
PORT=3001                      # Server port
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000  # React app URL

# Optional  
MAX_PLAYERS_PER_ROOM=8         # Max players per game
DRAWING_TIME_LIMIT=60          # Drawing time in seconds
```

### **Client Environment Variables**
```env
REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3001  # Server URL
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### **Manual Testing Flow**
1. Start server and client
2. Open multiple browser tabs/windows
3. Create room in one tab
4. Join with room code in other tabs
5. Test complete game flow

### **AI Testing**
```bash
cd server
node -e "
const AIJudge = require('./aiJudge');
const judge = new AIJudge();
judge.testConnection().then(console.log);
"
```

## 📊 What's New vs P2P Version

### **✅ Improvements**
- **Reliable connections** - No NAT traversal issues
- **Server-authoritative** - Prevents cheating
- **Better AI integration** - More processing power
- **Simpler deployment** - Standard web hosting
- **Error handling** - Graceful fallbacks

### **🔄 Maintained**
- **Same game concept** - All players draw + AI judges
- **Same UI components** - Minimal visual changes  
- **Same game flow** - Lobby → Vote → Draw → Results
